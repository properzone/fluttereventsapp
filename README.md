# fluttereventsapp

This a flutter app using firebase, where you can login anonymously, create events, view other people's events and edit your events.

## Getting Started

In order to run the app you need to add your firebase project settings to the app.

Open Xcode -> Add files to runner -> Select your google-services-plist file

Note: You have to use the same bundle Id in your firebase project, for android build and for ios build

## Dependancies

This app uses [GetX](https://pub.dev/packages/get) state management and [intl](https://pub.dev/packages/intl) package for managing date formatting.
